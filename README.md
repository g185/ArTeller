# Brief Decription

In our idea we would like to locate nearby the different statues a QR code that the user can scan using his personal smartphone.
Once scanned, a web application will present useful information about the statue that can be downloaded by the user.
Furthemore, the scan will trigger an actuator that will perform an action (as trigger lights, sounds, records etc..)
The web application will provide useful insights based on the use of the system to the manager.
