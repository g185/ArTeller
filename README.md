# InteractiPedia


## Brief Decription
Our goal is to build a all-in-one service that make a visit more interasting and insightful. 
The idea consist in locating nearby the operas a QR code or NFC sensor that the user can interact with using his personal smartphone.
Once scanned, a web application will present useful information about the opera that can be downloaded by the user.
Furthemore, the scan will trigger an actuator that will perform an action (as trigger different lights, records or change luminosity) in order to give a feedback to the user
The web application will provide useful insights based on the use of the system to the manager.
