# Evaluation

## Face Recognition
For this aspect of the project we will evaluate the following:
	
	1. Face Recognition speed

	2. Number of false positives

	3. Number of false negatives

## Talking Sculptures
For this aspect of ArTeller we will evaluate the following:

	1. Loudness of the speaker
	
	2. Interferences within multiple speakers
	
## MQTT
Concerning the MQTT part, we will evaluate the following:

	1. Responsiveness of the application
	
## AWS Backend
For what regards the AWS based backend we will evaluate the following:

	1. Usefulness of provided insights
	
	2. Latency

## Test
In order to test our solution, since we cannot have access to real devices due to the Covid-19 emergency, we will proceed in this way:

	1. Face Recognition: we will test our face recognition technology using the webacams on our laptops

	2. MQTT architecture: we will test the MQTT architecture using Iot-Lab

	3. Cloud infrastructure: deployed on AWS
