#Test
	In order to test our solution, since we can not have real devices due to the Covid-19 emergency, we will proceed in this way:

	1. Face Recognition: we will test our face recognition technology using the webacams on our laptops

	2. MQTT architecture: we will test the MQTT architecture using Iot-Lab

	3. Cloud infrastructure: deployed on AWS
