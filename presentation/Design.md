# Storyboards 

1. Simone is a curious kid in a school trip at the Sapienza Museum. As every millennial he likes to interact with everithyng using his smartphone. He sees the QR codes and scans them. He receives interesting informations about the sculputure and enjoys it.
He then sees how his scan have activated a light on the sculpture. After that, he notice how the different statues have different lighting based on the number of scan (interest) they had.

2. Margherita has a new statue and has to place it in a Museum room. In this room there is no place for another statue, so she needs to understand which one is less interesting. She uses the statistics displayed in the application in order to decide which one she can replace. Once she sees that statue_1 produces less interest, she replaces it with the new statue.
